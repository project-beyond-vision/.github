## Beyond Vision

Beyond Vision is a prototype of a smart walking cane and waist belt that is capable of detecting falls using machine learning, fires and relaying location information to the registered contact via Telegram messaging. The smart walking cane also has a panic button which the user can press when they are distressed and can also sound out when the user is too close to an obstacle.
